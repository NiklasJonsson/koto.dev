# Getting Started

## Installing Koto

Installing the Koto command-line interface (CLI) currently requires the 
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org) toolchain, 
see [rustup.sh](https://rustup.sh) for installation instructions.

With Rust available on your system, the `koto` command can be installed with
`cargo install koto_cli`.

Running `koto` without arguments will start the Koto 
[REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop), where Koto
expressions can be entered and evaluated interactively. 

This guide, along with the [core library reference](../../core), 
can be read in the REPL using the `help` command.
